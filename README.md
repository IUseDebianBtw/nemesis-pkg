# nemesis-pkg
A fast and simple package manager for Nemesis inspired from `kiss` and `pacman`. This is completely written from scratch...

# usage:-
`nemsis-pkg` has various flags that performs operations and some operations have their args.

- [x] `sync` flag to sync the package database
- [ ] `log` flag to see the total operations performed by `nemesis-pkg`
- [ ] `query`

### depreciations:
- [x] `history` its pretty much like logs and logs are way simpler and minimal[DEPRECIATED as of build 23625]
